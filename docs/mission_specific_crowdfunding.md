# Mission

You can use our template for mission specific crowdfunding. What does that mean? It means you set up a site that does one thing well. A razor focus on one aspect of the great work. Here are some examples:

- **Helping homeless people in Minnesota** You can make a simple site that helps homeless delivery and fidning jobs.  
- **Picking up plastic bottles in Malacca** What if you wanted to clean plastic bottles in your town? 
- **Teaching python to kids in Bali**. Take our software and do anything you want with it. The only limit is your imagination. 
- **Buying drum sticks and snare drums for people in Scotland** If you get a young person a pair of drumsticks, it coudl change their path forever. 
- **Buying Vitamin C or Magnesium for people who need it** (to use Kalki, you need some HTML, CSS and coding skills). If you want to learn coding and start to raise money, maybe we can help.
