# Kalki Mission Statement

We aim to get users hourly work as quickly as possible. You can crowdfund a small amount of money, then later larger amounts. 

## What can I crowdfund?

Try and crowdfund 30USD to pick up some trash in the local area... 20USD to learn how to plant a tree, 50USD for a new Ukulele, or 100USD to start a home farm. 

## Projects we're excited about:

- Picking up trash

- Planting Trees

- Dehydrating Food

- Sprout Farming

- Vegetarian and Vegan food.

- Home Energy

- Buying low cost musical instruments.

- Learning programming or other technology skills. 

- Learning music.

- Learning other skills that benefit your city. 

Remember, when you’re asking for money, you’re asking an entire city. Say why what you're doing should benefit the entire city.
