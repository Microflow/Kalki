Kalki is an open source app to help people raise micro-donations. We want to help people raise money to clean trash in beauty spots, plant trees, and plant flowers. 

The lastest build is here, as a codepen project:

https://codepen.io/Teeke/project/editor/XaLyOk

If you wish to help, please check the issues. We want to keep this version as a three file codepen project. This will halp non-tech people make their own fork.
